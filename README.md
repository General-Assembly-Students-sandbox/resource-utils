#### â‘ƒ Forking and Collaborating

The structure of this repository provides a way for us to organize our information and resources.

We encourage the teaching team for each cohort to fork this repository directly, and use it to create resources for your own instance. Please make sure to submit new materials back to the master so we can share them with students and instructors world-wide!

If you have any questions about the organization of resources, or about the scope of our curriculum, feel free to jump into the `#dsi-instructors` channel on Slack and let us know!
